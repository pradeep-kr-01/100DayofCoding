# 100 Days of Code Challenge: Java and DSA

Welcome to my 100-day coding challenge! ðŸš€ In this journey, I'll be diving deep into Java programming and mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Join me as I code, learn, and conquer!

## What's This Challenge About?

- **Objective**: To consistently code for 100 days.
- **Languages**: Java for coding practice.
- **Topics Covered**:
    - Data Structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.)
    - Algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, etc.)
    - System Design
    - Operating Systems and Databases
    - Object-Oriented Design
    - Cultural Fit (communication, teamwork, problem-solving)

## Repository Structure

- `java/`: Contains Java code files.
- `dsa/`: Includes DSA-related code.
- `system_design/`: Resources related to system design.
- `os_dbms/`: Materials on operating systems and databases.
- `ood/`: Object-oriented design principles.
- `interview_prep/`: Interview-specific content.
- `daily_logs/`: Daily progress logs.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/100-days-of-code-java-dsa.git
   ```

2. Create a new branch for each day's work:
   ```
   git checkout -b day1
   ```

3. Add your code, documentation, and daily logs.

4. Commit and push your changes:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Day 1: Solved a binary search problem"
   git push origin day1
   ```

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for the next 99 days!
